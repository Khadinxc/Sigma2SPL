# Description: Detects when a Microsoft Cloud App Security reported for users whose account were terminated in Azure AD, but still perform activities in other platforms such as AWS or Salesforce.
# This is especially relevant for users who use another account to manage resources, since these accounts are often not terminated when a user leaves the company.
