# Title: Suspicious Invocation of Shell via Rsync
# Author: Florian Roth
# Date: 2025-01-18
# Level: high
# Description: Detects the execution of a shell as sub process of "rsync" without the expected command line flag "-e" being used, which could be an indication of exploitation as described in CVE-2024-12084. This behavior is commonly associated with attempts to execute arbitrary commands or escalate privileges, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further exploitation.
