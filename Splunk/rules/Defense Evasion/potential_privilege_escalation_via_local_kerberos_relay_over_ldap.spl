# Title: Potential Privilege Escalation via Local Kerberos Relay over LDAP
# Author: Elastic, @SBousseaden
# Date: 2022-04-27
# Level: high
# Description: Detects a suspicious local successful logon event where the Logon Package is Kerberos, the remote address is set to localhost, and the target user SID is the built-in local Administrator account.
# This may indicate an attempt to leverage a Kerberos relay attack variant that can be used to elevate privilege locally from a domain joined limited user to local System privileges.
