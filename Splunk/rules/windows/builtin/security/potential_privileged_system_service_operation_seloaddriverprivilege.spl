# Title: Potential Privileged System Service Operation - SeLoadDriverPrivilege
# Author: xknow (@xknow_infosec), xorxes (@xor_xes)

# Level: medium
# Description: Detects the usage of the 'SeLoadDriverPrivilege' privilege. This privilege is required to load or unload a device driver.
# With this privilege, the user can dynamically load and unload device drivers or other code in to kernel mode.
# This user right does not apply to Plug and Play device drivers.
# If you exclude privileged users/admins and processes, which are allowed to do so, you are maybe left with bad programs trying to load malicious kernel drivers.
# This will detect Ghost-In-The-Logs (https://github.com/bats3c/Ghost-In-The-Logs) and the usage of Sysinternals and various other tools. So you have to work with a whitelist to find the bad stuff.

# False Positives:
#   - Other legimate tools loading drivers. Including but not limited to, Sysinternals, CPU-Z, AVs etc. A baseline needs to be created according to the used products and allowed tools. A good thing to do is to try and exclude users who are allowed to load drivers.
