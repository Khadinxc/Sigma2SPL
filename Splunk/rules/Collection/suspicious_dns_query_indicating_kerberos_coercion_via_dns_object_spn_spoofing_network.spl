# Level: high
# Description: Detects DNS queries containing patterns associated with Kerberos coercion attacks via DNS object spoofing.
# The pattern "1UWhRCAAAAA..BAAAA" is a base64-encoded signature that corresponds to a marshaled CREDENTIAL_TARGET_INFORMATION structure.
# Attackers can use this technique to coerce authentication from victim systems to attacker-controlled hosts.
# It is one of the strong indicators of a Kerberos coercion attack, where adversaries manipulate DNS records
# to spoof Service Principal Names (SPNs) and redirect authentication requests like CVE-2025-33073.
