# Description: Detects suspicious activity associated with Atomic MacOS Stealer (Amos) campaigns, including execution of FileGrabber and curl-based POST requests used for data exfiltration. The rule identifies either the execution of FileGrabber targeting /tmp or the use of curl to POST sensitive user data (including files such as /tmp/out.zip) to remote servers, which are key indicators of Amos infostealer activity.
