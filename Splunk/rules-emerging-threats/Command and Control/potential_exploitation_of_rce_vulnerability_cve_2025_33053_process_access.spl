# Level: high
# Description: Detects potential exploitation of remote code execution vulnerability CVE-2025-33053
# by looking for process access that involves legitimate Windows executables (iediagcmd.exe, CustomShellHost.exe)
# accessing suspicious executables hosted on WebDAV shares. This indicates an attacker may be exploiting
# Process.Start() search order manipulation to execute malicious code from attacker-controlled WebDAV servers
# instead of legitimate system binaries. The vulnerability allows unauthorized code execution through
# external control of file names or paths via WebDAV.
